# Homebrew-universal: universal formulas in immigration

Sometime in early 2017, [Homebrew core developers decided][1] that there is no longer a need to keep
universal formulas in the repository and removed them. Some of these formulas I need to maintain 
universal versions of the Python interpreter on macOS. 


## How to use?

```bash
brew install sashkab/universal/FORMULA --universal
```
