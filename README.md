# Deprecated

It became impossible to build universal formulas on latest versions of macOS, therefor this tap is deprecated.
[With the release of Homebrew 2.0 support for building universal binaries will be removed from Homebrew.][2]

On 2019.01.09 all formulas were removed.

To untap, please run:

```sh
brew untap sashkab/universal
```
